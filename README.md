# 2D-Platformer
Pokemon inspired 2D platformer, final project for Comp Sci 2.
Our goal was to create any 2D game and then show off our creation on the final day of class. Given 2 weeks to do this project, I liked the results produced. Was also the first time making a "real" game. The class was seperated into groups of 4 people, and each person was delegated a specific role. I was in charge of level generation and the fighting scene, however I did help out in various other parts whenever my classmates ran into a problem. The goal is to just reach the end of the map, which is to the far right. If you walk on tall grass for a while, there is a percentage that you'll encounter an enemy (just like in pokemon). And given the limited amount of time, we couldn't make as many assets as planned so the enemy always looks the same!
